        h1 Welcome to pug
        p This is the most commonly used
        p way of writing HTML using pug.

        p
            | Hence we use piping to avoid this problem
            | as long as we are piping the content
            | it is going to remain in a single tag
            | the relevant HTML is given below

            | Hello World!
            | I am Pug, your buddy to write simple HTML templates
            em Let's explore the world, shall we?
            | Very nice to meet you :)

        // 
            This section used for writing the Interpolation concept of the Variables
            In pug we can use interpolation to use local variables as well as the HTML tag interpolation to buffer
            a modified text into a paragraph or a bulk of text

        - var title = '5 habits of highly influential people';
        - var author = "Steven R Covey";
        - var escapedHtml = '<span>escape!</span>';

        div
            // Template local evaluation
            h3= title
            p Written with love by #{author}
            // The value after safe has been processed to removed code that if unescaped might cause issues to the code.
            p This will be safe: #{escapedHtml}
        
        //  
            The following two paragraphs represent the tag interpolation
            And the following paragraphs use the Strong tag as well as the
            Emphasize tag to process the text and buffer that text in the paragraph.
            TAG Interpolation is very useful in cases where Whitespaces need to e controlled.
            If we don't use Tag Interpolation, it could produce unexpected results.
            
        p. 
            This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
            Suddenly there is a #[strong strongly worded phrase] that cannot be
            #[em ignored].

        p. 
            Here is an example of tag interpolation with attributes
            #[q(lang="es") Â¡Hola Mundo!]

        script. 
            if(window.navigator.geolocation) {
                console.log('Geolocation available!');
            } else {
                console.warn("Geolocation not available!");
            }
        
        style(type="text/css").
            body {
                margin: 0;
                font-family: cursive;
            }

            p {
                margin-left: 100px;
                font-size: 14px;
