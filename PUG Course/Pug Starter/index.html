    <h1>Welcome to pug</h1>
    <p>This is the most commonly used</p>
    <p>way of writing HTML using pug.</p>
    <p>
      Hence we use piping to avoid this problem
      as long as we are piping the content
      it is going to remain in a single tag
      the relevant HTML is given below
    </p>

      Hello World!
      I am Pug, your buddy to write simple HTML templates<em>Let's explore the world, shall we?</em>Very nice to meet you :)

    <p>
      Hence we use piping to avoid this problem
      as long as we are piping the content
      it is going to remain in a single tag

    <!-- 
    This section used for writing the Interpolation concept of the Variables
    In pug we can use interpolation to use local variables as well as the HTML tag interpolation to buffer
    a modified text into a paragraph or a bulk of text
    
    -->
    <div>
      <!-- Template local evaluation-->
      <h3>5 habits of highly influential people</h3>
      <p>Written with love by Steven R Covey</p>
      <!-- The value after safe has been processed to removed code that if unescaped might cause issues to the code.-->
      <p>This will be safe: &lt;span&gt;escape!&lt;/span&gt;</p>
    </div>
    <!--  
    The following two paragraphs represent the tag interpolation
    And the following paragraphs use the Strong tag as well as the
    Emphasize tag to process the text and buffer that text in the paragraph.
    TAG Interpolation is very useful in cases where Whitespaces need to e controlled.
    If we don't use Tag Interpolation, it could produce unexpected results.

    <p>
      This is a very long and boring paragraph that spans multiple lines.
      Suddenly there is a <strong>strongly worded phrase</strong> that cannot be
      <em>ignored</em>.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of tag interpolation with attributes
      
      <q lang="es">Â¡Hola Mundo!</q>
      
    </p>
    <script>
      if(window.navigator.geolocation) {
          console.log('Geolocation available!');
      } else {
          console.warn("Geolocation not available!");
      }
      
    </script>
